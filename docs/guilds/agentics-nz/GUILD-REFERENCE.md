## Mission & Vision

### Tagline
> "Promoting applied agentic engineering practice and education in NZ"

### Core Focus Areas
1. **Applied Agentic Engineering** — Practical implementation of AI agent systems
2. **AI Education** — Building pathways from novice to productive agentic engineer
3. **Sovereign AI** — Local control over AI infrastructure, data, and models
4. **Open Source** — Supporting development of open source agentic AI systems
5. **Community Building** — Creating a guild structure with mentorship and knowledge sharing

### The Guild Philosophy
From the founding presentation:

> "Guilds have always been about people. Medieval guilds were communities where craftspeople set standards, trained apprentices, and supported one another. They protected quality and preserved knowledge through master-apprentice relationships—social contracts built on trust and shared responsibility.
>
> The Agentics Foundation carries that spirit into the AI era. Our craft is building agentic systems that operate safely and ethically. Like traditional guilds, we focus on mentorship, knowledge sharing, and setting standards that protect both the craft and its practitioners."

## Technical Themes & Topics

### From Blog Content

#### 1. Continuous Machine Cognition
The community explores what happens when AI can "think" indefinitely with local compute:

**Key Concepts:**
- Token abundance vs. scarcity economics
- Working memory limitations (~128K tokens)
- External memory systems for persistence
- "Dreaming" as knowledge consolidation

**The GRASP Framework:**
1. **G**enerate — Exhaustive exploration without efficiency constraints
2. **R**eview — Validate against criteria
3. **A**bsorb — Update external memory
4. **S**ynthesise — Consolidate into structured understanding
5. **P**ersist — Maintain continuity toward goals

#### 2. AI Dreaming Architecture
Proposed phases for machine cognition consolidation:
1. Experience Capture
2. Triage Sleep (deduplication, filtering)
3. Deep Dreaming (compression, abstraction, integration)
4. Pruning (active forgetting)
5. Integrity Verification

#### 3. Sovereign AI for NZ
Five pillars identified:
1. **Data Sovereignty** — Local training data, Te Reo Māori, Pacific languages
2. **Infrastructure Autonomy** — Reduced dependence on foreign cloud providers
3. **Regulatory Sovereignty** — Te Tiriti-aligned frameworks
4. **Economic Sovereignty** — Domestic capability building
5. **Competitive Advantage** — AgTech, environmental AI, public sector innovation

#### 4. Agentic Engineering vs Vibe Coding
| Agentic Engineer | Vibe Coder |
|------------------|------------|
| Follows a plan | Follows curiosity |
| Defined architecture | Creates by instinct |
| Clear process | In the moment |

> "Both have value" — The community values both approaches.

#### 5. State of the Art (SOTA) Practices
- **Tools:** Claude Code (Anthropic) + claude-flow (rUv)
- **Isolation:** Agents = security minefield
- **Workflow:** Spec (S) → Design (PA) → TDD (RC)
- **Speed:** Swarms (parallel agents)
- **Philosophy:** Fail Fast

## Educational Framework

### Learning Philosophy
From Dr Simon McCallum's presentation:

> "Learning is changing what is in our brains. Humans take time and effort to learn. AI can make some things easy—if you want to learn you need to keep pushing. Move the goalposts—choose your goals and extend."

### Zone of Proximal Development
- Learning happens at the edge of capabilities
- Mentors expand capability boundaries
- Agentic development is a new skill—no one has all the answers

### Questing as Learning
- New apprenticeships include **Independent Exploration**
- Change is constant, so exploration is critical
- Knowing what to **forget** (e.g., API specifics)
- Assessment by consent—intrinsic motivation to learn

### Open Questions for the Community
1. What is the pathway from novice to productive Agentic Engineer?
2. How to accredit mentors and curriculum?
3. How much theory is needed for high-quality AgEng?
4. What's the best analogy for general public understanding?
5. To accredit with NZQA or not?

### Craft to Engineering Progression
> "We are currently Agentic Crafters. Engineering is when craft becomes unified and tested."

- Apprenticeships transfer craft knowledge
- Extract key learnings from mentor-student relationships
- Agree on learning pathways
- Build curriculum based on experiences

## The Opportunity (NZ Context)

Why agentic AI matters for New Zealand:
1. Help SMEs and solo operators reduce paperwork, scale operations
2. Accelerate existing strengths (AgTech, environmental management)
3. Solve problems that were once too expensive to solve
4. Enable hyper-tailored customer-centric business models
5. Create real pathways for next generation of workers

### The Future of Work Bet
> More **conductors** (orchestrating AI), fewer individual **performers** (doing repetitive tasks)
