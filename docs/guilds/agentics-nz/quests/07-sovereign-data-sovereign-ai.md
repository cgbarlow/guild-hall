## Narrative Context

"Can New Zealand afford not to control its AI destiny?" This question haunts our digital future. Most AI models reflect American and European perspectives—where does that leave Te Reo Māori, Pacific languages, and our bicultural identity? This quest explores the five pillars of AI sovereignty.

## Transformation Goal

You will understand the strategic importance of sovereign AI, be able to articulate NZ-specific risks and opportunities, and identify concrete actions for building local capability.

## Design Notes

This quest addresses strategic literacy, ensuring guild members understand the "why" behind sovereign AI, not just the "how." The Te Tiriti objective reflects NZ's bicultural context.
