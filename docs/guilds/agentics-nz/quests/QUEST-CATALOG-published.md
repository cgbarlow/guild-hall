## Agentics 101

**Difficulty:** Apprentice

*Course Creators: Bradley Ross, Nicholas Ruest, The Agentics Foundation*

Every master was once a beginner. This quest marks your first steps into the world of agentic engineering—learning to direct AI agents rather than simply chatting with them.

If you've ever tried to write code with ChatGPT and ended up with a broken mess, you aren't alone. This course isn't about learning to type syntax. It's about learning to think. You are going to stop being a "User" and start being a "Product Manager." By the end of this course, you won't just be chatting with a bot; you will be directing an autonomous agent to build, style, and deploy a real website.

The manual workflow we use isn't a limitation—it's a feature. By acting as the "hands" between the Brain (Claude) and the Hard Drive (GitHub), you'll develop the most critical skill in agentic engineering: verification.

**Your Learning Path:**
- Module 0: Setup
- Module 1: The Theory
- Module 2: The Spec
- Module 3: The Infrastructure
- Module 4: The Build
- Module 5: Safety
- Module 6: The Future

**Transformation Goal:**
You will transform from a passive AI "user" into an active "Product Manager" who can direct autonomous agents to build real software. You will learn the critical skill of verification that separates successful agentic workflows from broken code.

## Quest 1: First Steps in the Realm

**Difficulty:** Apprentice

Every legendary agentic engineer began as a curious wanderer. Before you can command swarms of AI agents, you must first understand the landscape you're entering. This quest marks your initiation into the guild.

**Transformation Goal:**
You will move from curious observer to active participant—someone who knows where to find answers, who to ask, and how the community operates.

---

## Quest 2: The Prompt Whisperer

**Difficulty:** Apprentice

In ages past, commanding powerful forces required complex incantations. Today, a new form of magic has emerged—the ability to commune with large language models. Master this art, and you'll unlock capabilities that would have seemed like sorcery a decade ago.

**Transformation Goal:**
You will develop confidence in crafting effective prompts, a mental framework for breaking complex requests into clear instructions, and a portfolio of prompts you've created and refined.

---

## Quest 3: Local Model Liberation

**Difficulty:** Apprentice

The cloud giants offer convenience, but true sovereignty requires the ability to run AI on your own terms. Local models mean your data stays yours, your costs become predictable, and you're never cut off from your tools. This is the path to independence.

**Transformation Goal:**
You will gain hands-on experience running LLMs locally, understand the trade-offs between local and cloud inference, and have a working setup you can build upon.

---

## Quest 5: She'll Be Right Compliance

**Difficulty:** Journeyman

Kiwi tradies are legendary for their work ethic but notorious for their paperwork aversion. Health & Safety compliance is critical but tedious. What if an AI agent could handle the boring bits? This is AI with a practical Kiwi purpose.

**Transformation Goal:**
You will prototype an AI solution for a real NZ compliance problem, learning to navigate local regulations while building something genuinely useful for small businesses.

---

## Quest 8: Agent Swarm Commander

**Difficulty:** Apprentice

A single agent is powerful. A coordinated swarm is transformative. The Agentics Foundation's tools—Claude Code and claude-flow—enable orchestration of parallel agents working toward shared goals. Master this, and you become a conductor of digital intelligence.

**Transformation Goal:**
You will gain practical experience orchestrating multi-agent systems, understand coordination patterns and failure modes, and build something that demonstrates swarm capabilities.

---

## Quest 9: The Mentor's Path

**Difficulty:** Expert

Guilds have always transferred knowledge through mentorship. The master guides the apprentice, sharing not just technique but wisdom—the subtle art of knowing when to push and when to step back. Now it's your turn to give back to those following in your footsteps.

**Transformation Goal:**
You will develop mentoring skills, deepen your own understanding by teaching, and directly contribute to the guild's mission of building the next generation of agentic engineers.

## Quest 10: Gorse Bot 3000 — AgTech Agent

**Difficulty:** Master

Gorse is the golden curse of New Zealand's pastures—beautiful but invasive, choking out native species and productive farmland. Traditional control is expensive and labor-intensive. What if AI agents could coordinate targeted treatment? This is agentic engineering for greener pastures.

**Transformation Goal:**
You will apply agentic AI to a real NZ agricultural problem, learning to work with domain experts, geospatial data, and practical deployment constraints.

---

## Quest 11: The Sovereign Engine

**Difficulty:** Journeyman

Forge the software layer that transforms guild hardware into a community resource for local AI experimentation, free from external API dependencies. Set up llama.cpp server, implement secure OpenAI-compatible API, build a web frontend, integrate Hugging Face model browsing, write comprehensive documentation, and deploy to production hardware.

**Transformation Goal:**
You will architect and deploy a complete local AI inference platform, giving the community hands-on access to run models on dedicated hardware. You will first prove the entire system on your own equipment, then guide production deployment on the guild's HP Z2 Mini.
