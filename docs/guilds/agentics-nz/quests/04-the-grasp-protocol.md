## Narrative Context

Chris Barlow's GRASP framework represents the cutting edge of continuous machine cognition—a cycle of Generate, Review, Absorb, Synthesise, and Persist. Few have attempted to implement it. Will you be among the first to bring theory into practice?

---

## Transformation Goal

You will deeply understand the GRASP framework, implement a working prototype, and contribute to the guild's collective knowledge of continuous cognition architectures.

## Objectives

### Objective 1: Deep Study
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 20 |
| **Evidence** | Text |
| **Depends On** | — |

Read both parts of "What Happens When the Machine Never Stops Thinking?" Take detailed notes on each GRASP phase.

---

### Objective 2: Architecture Design
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 30 |
| **Evidence** | Text + Link (diagram) |
| **Depends On** | Objective 1 |

Design a system architecture for implementing GRASP. Include memory storage, phase transitions, and validation mechanisms.

---

### Objective 3: Generate & Review
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 35 |
| **Evidence** | Link (code) |
| **Depends On** | Objective 2 |

Implement the Generate and Review phases. Demonstrate an agent that explores a topic and validates its outputs.

---

### Objective 4: Absorb & Synthesise
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 35 |
| **Evidence** | Link (code) |
| **Depends On** | Objective 3 |

Add external memory (vector DB, file system, etc.). Show the agent updating and consolidating knowledge.

---

### Objective 5: Persist & Present
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 30 |
| **Evidence** | Link |
| **Depends On** | Objective 4 |

Complete the cycle with goal persistence. Present your implementation at an AI Hackerspace event.

## Design Notes

This is a flagship quest for the guild, directly implementing concepts from the community's own research. The presentation requirement ensures knowledge flows back to the community.
