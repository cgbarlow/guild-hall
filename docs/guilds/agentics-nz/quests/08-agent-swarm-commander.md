# Quest: Agent Swarm Commander

## Narrative Context

A single agent is powerful. A coordinated swarm is transformative. The Agentics Foundation's tools—Claude Code and claude-flow—enable orchestration of parallel agents working toward shared goals. Master this, and you become a conductor of digital intelligence.

---

## Transformation Goal

You will gain practical experience orchestrating multi-agent systems, understand coordination patterns and failure modes, and build something that demonstrates swarm capabilities.

## Objectives

### Objective 1: Swarm Theory
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 25 |
| **Evidence** | Text |
| **Depends On** | — |

Study multi-agent coordination patterns (hierarchical, mesh, consensus). Document trade-offs of each approach.

---

### Objective 2: Tool Mastery
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 30 |
| **Evidence** | Text + Link |
| **Depends On** | Objective 1 |

Set up Claude Code with claude-flow. Successfully run a basic multi-agent workflow.

---

### Objective 3: Design a Swarm
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 35 |
| **Evidence** | Text + Link |
| **Depends On** | Objective 2 |

Design a swarm architecture for a non-trivial task (research, code review, content generation). Document agent roles and communication patterns.

---

### Objective 4: Build & Run
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 50 |
| **Evidence** | Link (video/code) |
| **Depends On** | Objective 3 |

Implement your swarm. Demonstrate it completing a real task with observable coordination.

---

### Objective 5: Failure Analysis
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 30 |
| **Evidence** | Text |
| **Depends On** | Objective 4 |

Document what went wrong, where agents drifted, and how you'd improve the design.

---

### Objective 6: Teach Others
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 30 |
| **Evidence** | Link |
| **Depends On** | Objective 5 |

Create a tutorial or present at AI Hackerspace on what you learned.

## Design Notes

This is the highest-point quest, reflecting its difficulty and value to the guild. The failure analysis objective acknowledges that swarm coordination is hard—learning from failures is part of the craft.
