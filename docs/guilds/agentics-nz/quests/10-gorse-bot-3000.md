## Narrative Context

Gorse is the golden curse of New Zealand's pastures—beautiful but invasive, choking out native species and productive farmland. Traditional control is expensive and labor-intensive. What if AI agents could coordinate targeted treatment, identifying gorse patches from imagery and optimizing eradication efforts? This is agentic engineering for greener pastures.

---

## Transformation Goal

You will apply agentic AI to a real NZ agricultural problem, learning to work with domain experts, geospatial data, and practical deployment constraints.

## Objectives

### Objective 1: Know Your Enemy
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 25 |
| **Evidence** | Text + Link |
| **Depends On** | — |

Research gorse biology, current control methods, and the scale of the problem in NZ. Interview a farmer or DOC ranger if possible.

### Objective 2: Data Reconnaissance
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 25 |
| **Evidence** | Text + Link |
| **Depends On** | — |

Identify available data sources: satellite imagery, drone footage, existing weed mapping projects. Document access methods.

---

### Objective 3: Detection Design
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 35 |
| **Evidence** | Text + Link |
| **Depends On** | Objectives 1, 2 |

Design an AI system for gorse detection from imagery. Could be ML classification, vision model prompting, or hybrid approach.

---

### Objective 4: Prototype Detection
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
