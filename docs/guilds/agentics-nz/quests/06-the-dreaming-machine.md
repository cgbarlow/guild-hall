## Narrative Context

Humans consolidate memories during sleep—pruning, connecting, and transforming raw experience into lasting knowledge. What if AI could dream? The guild has theorized a five-phase dreaming architecture. Now it's time to build it.

---

## Transformation Goal

You will push the boundaries of AI memory architecture, implementing systems that don't just accumulate data but actively process, consolidate, and refine knowledge over time.

---

## Objectives

### Objective 1: Study Sleep Science
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 25 |
| **Evidence** | Text |
| **Depends On** | — |

Research the five biological sleep functions mapped to AI (memory consolidation, synaptic homeostasis, creative recombination, predictive refinement, emotional processing). Document each.

---

### Objective 2: Experience Capture
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 30 |
| **Evidence** | Link (code) |
| **Depends On** | Objective 1 |

Build a system that logs agent interactions with uncertainty markers and contradiction flags.

---

### Objective 3: Triage Sleep
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 35 |
| **Evidence** | Link (code) |
| **Depends On** | Objective 2 |

Implement deduplication, salience filtering, and chunk formation on captured experiences.

---

### Objective 4: Deep Dreaming
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 40 |
| **Evidence** | Link (code) |
| **Depends On** | Objective 3 |

Add at least two of: compression, abstraction, integration, counterfactual generation, or adversarial testing.

---

### Objective 5: Integrity Verification
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 30 |
| **Evidence** | Link (code) |
| **Depends On** | Objective 4 |

Implement coherence checking and hallucination detection on consolidated knowledge.

---

### Objective 6: Dream Journal
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Points** | 15 |
| **Evidence** | Text + Link |
| **Depends On** | Objective 5 |

Document your architecture, findings, and open questions. Share with the guild.

## Design Notes

This is the most advanced memory architecture quest, building on concepts from the guild's research. The "Dream Journal" requirement ensures learnings are documented for future questers.
