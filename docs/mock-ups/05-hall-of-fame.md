## Design Notes

The Hall of Fame serves different purposes than the Leaderboard:

1. **Permanent recognition** — Leaderboard ranks change; Hall of Fame achievements are forever
2. **Diverse achievement types** — Not just points, but firsts, mentorship, community impact
3. **Story-driven** — Quotes and achievement narratives create emotional connection
4. **Aspiration without pressure** — Empty frames invite participation, not competition
5. **Guild history** — Documents the community's journey and growth over time

### Achievement Categories for GM Configuration

GMs can create Hall of Fame entries for:
- **Quest Firsts** — Automatic: first completion of any quest
- **Milestone Badges** — Automatic: reaching defined point/quest thresholds
- **Named Trophies** — Manual: GM-created awards for exceptional contributions
- **Records** — Automatic: tracked superlatives (fastest, most, longest)
- **Featured Legend** — Manual: GM spotlight on outstanding member

### Inductee Notification

When inducted, members receive:
- In-app notification with fanfare animation
- Optional: shareable "achievement card" image
- Permanent profile badge for the achievement
