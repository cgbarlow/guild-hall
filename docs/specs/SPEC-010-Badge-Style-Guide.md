1. **Use 1:1 aspect ratio:** All badges must be square (e.g., 512×512px)
2. **Solid white background:** Image background must be pure white (`#ffffff`)
3. **Specify size context:** "badge that scales well from 24px to 120px"
4. **Request SVG-friendly output:** "simple shapes suitable for vector format"
5. **Limit colours:** "maximum 3-4 colours" keeps badges clean
6. **Centre the icon:** "icon centred within badge shape"
7. **Describe the concept:** Include what the badge represents (e.g., "collaboration", "first achievement", "mastery")
8. **Reference difficulty colours:** When generating difficulty-specific badges, always use the Guild Hall standard colours
